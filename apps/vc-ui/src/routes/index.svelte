	<h3>
		OUR MISSION
	</h3>
	<p>
		Votecube is a global opinion aggregator. We help solve global issues by connecting
		people locally and internationally.
		We promote cross-cultural understanding on issues that affect everyone across the
		planet by contrasting the voting outcomes.
		We host all content on Social Change and Global Impact without advertisements.
		<br>
		People of all ages are entitled to an opinion. Votecube is engineered from the
		ground up with a parental control system. Polls and opinions must be rated
		for age suitability by their creators. Overall decision of the community
		determines the effective rating of every item.
	</p>
	<h3>
		THE PRODUCT
	</h3>
	<p>
		We make opinion polls fun, engaging and informative.
		<br>
		Our unique multidimensional polls are presented in a form of a positioning game.
		The 3 dimensional form factor of our polls allows to extract meaningful information
		even for 50/50 splits in outcome. The community driven poll design system
		automatically picks the best factors to put into a poll. Our poll extension mechanism
		allows to gather information on any number of factors. Answering Votecube polls
		requires about a minute of user's time.
	</p>
	<h3>
		PRIVACY
	</h3>
	<p>
		Votecube ads are based purely on the content of the polls. We don't use cookies or
		any activity tracking. We are opening the source of our advertisement engine for
		review
		by community.
		<br>
		People should be free who ask and answer the hard, responsible questions. Their
		privacy should be protected. All Votecube data is anonymous by default.
	</p>
	<h3>
		INSIGHT
	</h3>
	<p>
		Votecube polls can be adjusted to better formulate positions. They are extended
		structurally to allow different factor compositions. They are also labeled and rated
		for age suitability. Ultimately the polls are evaluated and voted on.
		<br>
		We use the relations between poll versions, labels and ratings to gain insight on
		their topics. The composite vote of polls is used to understand the public opinion.
		We publish all statistical results of every public poll.
		Vote cube helps you figure out "why it is" and "what to do".
	</p>
	<h3>
		THE FUTURE
	</h3>
	<p>
		Most of personal data should be limited to friends and family.
		We are working on sharing polls directly with the people that matter.
		Our servers won't be aware of these private polls.
		<br>
		Public opinion should be gathered from real people, not bots. And only residents
		should vote in local polls. We are working on keeping public and local polls accurate
		while keeping users anonymous.
